We must remember that our objective as malware analysts is to provide information needed to detect, prevent and contain further intrusions that means determining exactly what happened and detecting all the infected machines and examining suspicious files in order to generate useful host/network based signatures to detect and prevent infections in our systems, when falling into a rabbit hole of reverse engineering one must remember what our main objective as analysts is.</description></item></channel></rss>
