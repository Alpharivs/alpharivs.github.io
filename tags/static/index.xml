That’s why you’re here, reversing this, instead of with them, because they don’t exist. We’ve found an unknown executable on one of our hosts. The file has been there for a while, but our networking logs only show suspicious traffic on one day. Can you tell us what happened?

Maybe you’re like us and spent the year playing Wordle. We made our own version that is too hard to beat without cheating Play it live at: http://flare-on.com/flaredle/ Challenge Overview Upon loading the website we are presented with some sort of Wordle game. Dynamic Analysis When testing the app it seems that it only accepts words with a minimum length. After some testing we can see that the length required is 21 characters, upon reaching the length the error message becomes &amp;ldquo;Word not in list!</description></item><item><title>Flare-On 2022 - Pixel Poker</title><link>https://alpharivs.github.io/writeups/flare_pixelpoker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alpharivs.github.io/writeups/flare_pixelpoker/</guid><description>Challenge Description I said you wouldn’t win that last one.

We must remember that our objective as malware analysts is to provide information needed to detect, prevent and contain further intrusions that means determining exactly what happened and detecting all the infected machines and examining suspicious files in order to generate useful host/network based signatures to detect and prevent infections in our systems, when falling into a rabbit hole of reverse engineering one must remember what our main objective as analysts is.</description></item></channel></rss>
